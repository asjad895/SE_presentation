        <h1>Technical Architecture & Source Code</h1>
        <p> <li>Frontend: Html,Css,Javascript</li>
            <li>Backend:Django,Python,Deep learning Model Api</li>
            <li>The frontend user interface allows users to submit a query image from their local system and view the 
            top K (any number) similar results. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive 
            layout and easy-to-use search function.</li>
            <li>The machine learning model is the heart of our content-based search engine. It is built using a Siamese neural 
            network architecture, which is trained on a large dataset of images using contrastive loss. The model is
             optimized for few-shot learning, allowing it to recognize similarities in content with minimal training data.
             </li>
            Overall, our application is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. The combination of a user-friendly 
            frontend, a powerful backend server, and a state-of-the-art machine learning model makes it an ideal solution 
            for anyone looking to quickly and accurately search for visual content.
