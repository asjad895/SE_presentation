        <h1>Future Works</h1>
        <p>
            <li>In the future, we plan to continue improving the performance of our content-based search engine by exploring new
                techniques such as transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning pre-trained models on our specific domain. 
                Additionally, we plan to customize our model for different genres, such as fashion, food, or travel, 
                to ensure better accuracy in recognizing visual features specific to each genre.</li>
            <li>To provide a more comprehensive search experience, we aim to integrate generative AI techniques that generate 
                images from text prompts, allowing users to search for similar images based on the generated content. 
                We also plan to enhance the user interface of our search engine by improving the design and layout to create a
                more intuitive and appealing experience.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, we plan to scale our backend infrastructure to handle an increased volume of queries and data, 
                ensuring that our search engine remains fast and responsive. We also aim to personalize the search results based 
                on the user's preferences, browsing history, and search behavior, to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
            <li> Overall, our goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of content-based search technology, redefining how people
                search and discover content in various industries. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques and technologies, 
                we believe our search engine will play a significant role in the future of search and discovery.</li>
