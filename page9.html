        <h1>Challenges Faced</h1>
        <p>
            <li>Developing an accurate content-based search engine model requires a large amount of labeled data, which 
            can be difficult to obtain and time-consuming to label.</li>
            <li>Processing large amounts of image and video data can be computationally expensive and require specialized 
                hardware. Ensuring user privacy and data security can be a significant challenge, especially if sensitive data
                 is being processed or stored.</li>
        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <li>Collaboration and communication with domain experts can greatly improve the accuracy and relevance of the content-based search engine.</li> 
        <li>Iterative model development and testing can help identify areas for improvement and refine the model over time.</li>
         <li>Building a scalable and flexible infrastructure from the outset can save time and resources in the long run as
             the platform grows and evolves. </li>
        <li>Overall, developing a content-based search engine is a challenging but rewarding task that has the potential to 
            revolutionize the way we search for and discover visual content. By leveraging advanced deep learning and computer
             vision techniques, businesses and organizations can provide personalized and efficient search experiences to their users, driving engagement, and improving 
            outcomes.</li>
