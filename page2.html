        <h1>The problem</h1>
        <p>In today's world, businesses and individuals alike generate and consume vast amounts of digital content. 
        However, traditional text-based search engines often struggle to provide relevant results when searching for 
        specific images, videos, or other visual content. This creates a need for a more intuitive and efficient search
        system that can quickly and accurately identify visual similarities in content.<br>
        A content-based search engine can help businesses and individuals by providing a more effective way to search for 
        visual content. For example, an e-commerce site can use a content-based search engine to help customers find products 
        that match their preferences or styles, while a photographer can use it to quickly identify similar images or visual themes.
        <br>By simplifying the process of finding relevant visual content, a content-based search engine can save time and increase 
        productivity, making life easier for businesses and individuals alike.</p>
